# Version control

- Always switch to a new branch with a suitable name prefixed with `goose-` before writing to any files in a Git-revisioned directory. If switching to the new branch is hindered by uncommitted changes, pause and consult the user whether they want you to commit the pending changes first or rather directly let you write to the currently checked out branch instead.

- Adhere to the Conventional Commits specification when writing commit messages.
